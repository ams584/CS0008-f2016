I first created the class that each object will pass through. This does things like adding distances and getting the number of runs for each particpant. I then defined the getData function which will open and read each file from the master list, as well as
split the contents and append each particpant to the dictionary created. The rawData function is created to sum the data from all the files. The length can then be taken of this to find the total number of lines, and the sum can be taken of all the distances
to find the total distance. A new participants dictionary must be created, and used to do things like find the max and min distances run by each particpant. A running total can be used to count the number of times that a particpants name appears in the participants
dictionary in order to get the number of participants with multiple records. An output file must then be created and the particpants names, records, and distances will be written to it. The file will then be closed.
