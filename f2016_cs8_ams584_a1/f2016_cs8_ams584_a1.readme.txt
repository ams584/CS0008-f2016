The first thing I did was ask for the user to provide units. I then created two if statements, each starting by asking
for distance and gas used in the proper units. After receiving both of these, the program converted them to the units
of the other system. This was done for the purpose of printing both types of units, and for calculating the consumption
rating. After both of these if statements, another was created to calculate consumption rating. After this, I had all
of the necessary information, so I printed them all out according to the table. The format function was used to make
sure there was enough space between each variable, and to print each variable with three decimal places.
